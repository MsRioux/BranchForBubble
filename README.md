# BranchForBubble
Clone this repo to your local machine. Create a branch using this convention: "yourNameBranch".
Commit with an appropriate message.
In your branch write the code for your Bubble Sort. You must commit at least once before you are finished. (i.e. once for
completing printArray() and once for bubbleSort()).  Commit your finshed project.  Push to the origin.

You will not be merging this, just practicing branching from a collaborative project and writing a bubble sort.
